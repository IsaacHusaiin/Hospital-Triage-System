# Hospital-Triage-System
This C++ project simulates a hospital triage system using priority-based patient management. The system leverages a priority queue (heap structure) to efficiently organize patient data based on urgency, allowing for streamlined processing of high-priority cases.

Features

	•	Efficient Patient Management: Uses a priority queue to prioritize patient entries, ensuring that critical cases are handled promptly.
	•	Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle a large number of patient entries, making it suitable for simulation in high-demand environments.
	•	User-Friendly Console Interface: Provides a simple command-line interface to input, process, and view patient data.

Project Structure

	•	main.cpp: Contains the main execution logic for the program.
	•	Patient.h / Patient.cpp: Defines the Patient class and its attributes, including name, urgency level, and arrival time.
	•	TriageSystem.h / TriageSystem.cpp: Implements the priority queue functionality and handles the triage operations.

Usage

	1.	Clone the repository.
	2.	Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
	3.	Run the program and follow the on-screen prompts to add and process patients based on urgency.

Technology

	•	C++
	•	Data Structures: Priority Queue (Heap)
